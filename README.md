# face-mask-detection
Abstract 
BSTRACT
Changes in the lifestyle of everyone around the world. In those changes wearing a mask has
been very vital to every individual. Detection of people who are not wearing masks is a
challenge due to Outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic which has created a large number of
populations. This project can be used in schools, hospitals, banks, airports, etc. as a digitalized
scanning tool. The technique of detecting peopleâ€™s faces and segregating them into two classes
namely the people with masks and people without masks is done with the help of image
processing and deep learning. With the help of this project, a person who is intended to monitor
the people can be seated in a remote area and still can monitor efficiently and give instructions
accordingly. Various libraries of python such as OpenCV, Tensor flow and Keras. In Deep
Learning Convolution Neural Networks is a class Deep Neural Networks which is used to train
the models used for this project.While entering the place everyone should scan their face
and then enter ensuring they have a mask with them. If anyone is found to be without a face
mask, a beep alert will be generated. As all the workplaces are opening,the number of cases of
COVID-19 is still getting registered throughout the country. If everyone follows the safety
measures, then it can come to an end. Hence to ensure that people wear masks while comi
